# Metric Network Time Protocol
Inspired by [metric-time.com](https://metric-time.com/)  
This is a little thing, designed to make "Metric Time" easily accesible  

## The protocol
The MNTP Server, can serve ALL timezones   
And the data is done over TCP on port 6980  
More info about the protocol structure is at [PacketStructure.txt](/PacketStructure.txt)

## The Client
The MNTP Client, will soon be upgraded. 
Currently you enter a timezone (Like Canada/Pacific or America/Los_Angeles)  
The you enter the Server IP.
